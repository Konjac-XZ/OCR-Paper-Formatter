<space-rule>
- Chinese characters and numbers: require a space. (e.g. 2025 年)
- Chinese characters and English words: require a space. (e.g. A/B 测试)
- Numbers and units: require a space, except for % and °. (e.g. 10 kg, 20%, 360°)
- Full-width Chinese punctuation and any character: do not require a space. (e.g. “你好，世界！”)
- Hyphens and slashes, backslashes: Do not add spaces. (e.g. 10-20, 10/20, 10\20)
